# 🎲 Farkle Companion

**Farkle Companion** is a website made to help people keep track of their scores while playing the dice game *Farkle*.

It can be boring and cumbersome to track your score using a calculator and paper, or a notepad on your smartphone—especially since you can "burst" and need to ignore the score from that round.

With this website, you can easily keep track of your score while playing with friends.
